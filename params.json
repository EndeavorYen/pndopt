{"name":"Pndopt","tagline":"THIS PROJECT HAS BEEN ABANDONED — Puzzle & Dragons optimizer","body":"pndopt --- Puzzle & Dragons Optimizer\r\n=====================================\r\n\r\n![Screenshot](screenshot.png)\r\n\r\n`pndopt` is a Javascript application to find an optimal path leading to a high-combo move in Puzzle & Dragons.\r\n\r\nOnly use it in emergency ☺!\r\n\r\n*(Yes I knew there were [Big Combo](http://www.fonescience.com/bigcombo/) and [Path & Decision](http://pnd.cubeforge.net/), but the former is gone and I'm unsatisfied with the result of the latter.)*\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-----\r\n\r\n1. Left or right click on an orb to select its type.\r\n2. Click \"Solve\" after completing the board.\r\n3. Choose one solution and see how it is performed.\r\n\r\nRequirements\r\n------------\r\n\r\n* Firefox (version 19 or above).\r\n* Screen resolution of 1280×800 or above.\r\n\r\nIt may work in other configurations but I don't guarantee it will work ☺.\r\n\r\nTODO\r\n----\r\n\r\n* Introduce better solver (e.g. [this post](http://puzzleanddragonsforum.com/showthread.php?tid=1603&pid=6263#pid6263)). Currently it is just a brute-force greedy algorithm, which may not produce truly optimal result.\r\n* Resolve overlapping lines and points.\r\n* Simulate swapping and matching when playing the animation.\r\n* The default weight of the profiles may need to be adjusted.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
